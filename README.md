# Capstone_VideoUniverseApp
An app for my local brick-and-mortar video store

1. As a user, I want to be able to check the availability of a movie so that I can reserve it online.
2. As a user, I want to be able to pay for my movie selections online so that I can quickly and easily pick it up in-person.
3. As a user, I want to be able to select a genre and have a recommendation randomly generated so that I know what to rent.
4. As a user, I want to be able to create a user profile to remember my favorite movies and get recommendations.
5. As a user, I want to be able to filter movie selections by media type (DVD, Blu-Ray, VHS) so that I can experience a wider variety of movie experiences.
6.
